\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We recruited 251 participants (133 female, 118 male) on the online
recruitment platform Prolific, screening for participants with an
approval rating above 95\% from previous studies. Participants ranged in
age from 18 to 75 years (\(\mu\)=35.6, Mdn=33, \(\sigma\)=11.9),
representing 32 nationalities and 20 primary languages. Participants
were compensated at \$12.00 per hour, with expected completion time
varying by condition (\textasciitilde20-40 minutes). All participants
provided informed consent prior to beginning the experiment. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the MGH Institute of
Health Professions.

experiment}

\end{figure}%

Like other serial reaction time task designs, our experiment tasks
participants to respond to a visual stimulus that appears in one of
several evenly-spaced positions on screen as quickly and accurately as
possible by pressing a corresponding key on the keyboard. In our
implementation, this visual stimulus is a mole garbed in a bright red
bib and matching sunglasses (Figure); and a schematic of each
position-to-keyboard mapping for each condition is shown in (Table).
Participants were evenly divided into 5 groups of 50 per condition, with
the conditions differing in the number of positions (4, 5, 6, 7, 8) the
mole can appear in.

A participant is first given a text-based tutorial accompanied by an
animated demonstration on which key to press in response to each
position, then instructed to work through a set of practice trials where
each position is visited twice in random order. After the practice
section, the participant moves on to complete 20 blocks of trials, each
separated with a self-paced break. Each block consists of trials 10x the
number of positions in the participant's assigned condition. This design
choice results in longer blocks for conditions with more positions, but
ensures each position is visited an equal number of times on average
across conditions. In both practice and main trials, participants are
given feedback on correctness via a pop-up short message (a checkmark
vs.~``Try again!'' + an error tone), and allowed to retry each failed
trial until they respond correctly. Following standard SRTT protocol,
there is also a 120ms response-stimulus interval (RSI) between trials
{[}CITE{]}. We find during piloting that allowing retries, combined with
the 120ms RSI, prevents participants from making compensatory errors,
where they unintentionally press the wrong key in the next trial in an
attempt to correct their current trial. After each block, participants
are given adaptive feedback based on their accuracy and speed. At the
end of the experiment, participants complete a brief questionnaire
probing their explicit awareness of any patterns in the mole's
appearances (Table).

In addition to our dapper mole, a number of design choices were made to
facilitate participant understanding and engagement. During the practice
phase, each position on screen is labelled with its corresponding key
character (e.g.~``A'', ``S'', ``D'') to help familiarize participants
with the keyboard mappings. These key labels disappear in the main
trials to prevent explicitly encoding of the sequence of positions via
their character labels, but reappear during retry of failed trials. To
make the correspondence between the positions on screen and keyboard
keys as automatic and intuitive as possible, we chose to use
conventional QWERTY-based finger layouts for the key mappings across
conditions (Table). We found during piloting that while this decision
helped reduce cognitive load from learning novel finger placements, the
larger gap between keys ``F'' and ``J'' on the keyboard introduced a
discrepancy between the evenly-spaced on-screen positions and the
unevenly spaced keyboard keys. This made participants more prone to
making errors in the positions towards the middle of the screen compared
to those on the outer edges, especially when number of positions
increases {[}TODO: maybe run stats on pilot to find this effect{]}; and
was not mitigated by shifting either hand's placement to close the extra
gap, because the positions were still corresponding half to one hand and
half to the other. After further piloting testing different visual aids,
we settled on adding two hands visually to the bottom of the screen,
each finger aligned with its target position (Figure). We received
verbal feedback that this visual aid helped participants better map the
spatial layout of the on-screen positions to their corresponding keys.
Lastly, the visual design of the ``positions'' on screen mimicked blank
3D keyboard keys that light up in pink when the mole appears on top, and
look visibly ``pressed down'' when the participant presses the
corresponding keyboard key. This design choice links the on-screen
positions diegetically to the physical keyboard keys to maximally reduce
mental distance between the two. This is important to enforce as much
learning via implicit motor memory as possible, rather than via
visual-spatial memory of the on-screen positions.

\subsection{Transition Matrices}\label{transition-matrices}

Our experiment deviates from other serial reaction time tasks in how the
sequence of positions and its probabilistic structure is constructed. In
each run of the experiment, we use a first-order Markov process to
generate the sequence of positions the mole appears in. This process is
defined by a transition matrix, where each entry in the matrix defines
the probability of transitioning from one position to another. We
designed five different transition matrices of sizes 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7,
and 8x8 respectively corresponding to the five conditions in our
experiment. These ``original'' matrices were constructed to have graded
and increasing levels of entropy across rows, such that the
next-position-transition of the first position is the most predictable,
followed by the second, with the last position being the least
predictable. For example, in the 4x4 matrix, position 1 has a high
probability (\textasciitilde0.97) of transitioning to position 2, a low
probability (\textasciitilde0.03) of transitioning to position 1, and
never transitions to position 3 or 4; while position 4 has a more
uniform distribution of transition probabilities to all other positions
(to 1: \textasciitilde(0.39)˘, to 2: \textasciitilde(0.03), to 3:
\textasciitilde(0.24), to 4: \textasciitilde(0.35)). This gives rise to
a gradient of entropy values across the positions, which results in a
much richer, messily distributed statistical structure underlying the
sequence of positions the mole appears in, allowing us to investigate
how the procedural learning system differentially picks up varying
levels of predictability in a given statistical structure.

Several design criteria/constraints were imposed on the construction of
these original transition matrices. First, these matrices had to be
doubly stochastic to ensure uniform visitation to each position over
time, preventing confounding effects from position frequency on
learning. Second, self-transitions (e.g.~position 1 to position 1)
should have near-zero probabilities, because data from repeated trials
have been historically thrown out from analysis in serial reaction time
tasks to prevent confounding motor effects from repeating the same
keypress {[}CITE{]}. Third, the graded entropy levels across the
positions should translate to graded probabilities across bigrams as
well, as having more fine-grained, distributed levels of transition
probabilities is our experiment's key distinction from other SRTT tasks,
such as the ASRT paradigm which only has 2 levels of trigram
probability. Fourth, the increase in entropy across positions
(i.e.~rows) should be significant between one another and as linear as
possible to ensure smooth a smooth gradient with meaningfully distinct
levels in predictability across positions. Strictly satisfying all these
constraints at once turned out to be not only non-trivial, but
mathematically impossible for our range of n\_positions (i.e.~matrix
sizes), so we wrote an optimization algorithm that explores the
candidate space for each matrix size, treating these constraints as soft
penalties to find a global minimum of the total constraint violation,
balancing trade-offs among the competing constraints.

The five original matrices we constructed using this algorithm had these
properties: 1) near fully doubly stochastic---all row and column sums
sum to 1 (±0.0001) {[}TODO: consider not hardcoding{]}; 2) approach a
uniform stationary distribution after 7 timesteps {[}TODO: consider not
hardcoding{]} where the stationary visitation for each state are within
0.001 of each other; 3) had a graded entropy structure across states
(positions)---each matrix had a positional entropy range of 0.061-0.181
bits for position 1 (\(\mu\)=0.107, \(\sigma\)=0.048), and 1.695-2.835
bits for highest (\(\mu\)=2.319, \(\sigma\)=0.451). Within a matrix each
position increases in entropy from the previous by 0.295-0.699 bits
(\(\mu\)=0.442, \(\sigma\)=0.085); and 4) avoided self loops as much as
possible---all of the matrices had \textless0.08 {[}TODO: consider not
hardcoding{]} probabilities in the diagonal up until the last two
positions. Within each matrix size condition, all participants
experience the same underlying entropy gradient across positions, but
the mapping between screen positions and entropy levels is randomized
through a double permutation procedure that shuffles the original matrix
(of that size) using the same random permutation. This preserves the
statistical properties of the original matrix---transition probabilities
and entropy values---but decouples entropy levels from specific screen
positions. The position sequence for each participant is subsequently
generated using their individual, shuffled transition matrix, such that
the sequence each participant experiences is different both within and
between matrix size conditions.
